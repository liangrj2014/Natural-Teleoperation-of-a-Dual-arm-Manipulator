#Teleoperating a dual-arm manipulator with the motion of human arms

The manipulator consists of two UR5 robots which are installed on a metal holder. The human motions are captured by the inertial Perception Neuron system and then mapped to the UR5 robots' capacity via the virtual-joint-based kinematics mapping approach.
